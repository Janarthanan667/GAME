1. Game Objective : The game asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 5, with feedback on whether the guess is correct or not.  

2. HTML Structure : Contains headings, an input box for the user's guess, a button to submit the guess, and placeholders for displaying results and score.  

3. Random Number Generation : A random number between 1 and 5 is generated at the start using JavaScript's Math.random().  

4. Input Handling : The user's guess is captured from the input box and compared to the generated random number.  

5. Result Display: If the user guesses correctly, a success message is displayed; otherwise, they see a loss message.  

6. Score Tracking : The initial score starts at 5, decreasing by 1 for each incorrect guess, dynamically updated in the UI.  

7. Alert Notification: When the user guesses correctly, a browser alert pops up to notify them of their win.  

8. Styling : The game uses CSS to add a gradient background, styled buttons, and colorful text for a visually appealing design.  

9. Dynamic Updates : The game updates the result and score in real-time based on the user's interaction without requiring a page reload.  

10. User limit : Clear messages help guide the user, and the score system adds a challenge by limiting the number of attempts.
